## The app has following packages:
- data: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
- ui: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
- utils: Utility classes.

## Components
- Glide - A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android https://github.com/bumptech/glide

- Data Binding - This is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

- Coroutines - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
